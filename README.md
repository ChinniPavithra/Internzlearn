**AI-Based Resume Screening Tool**

This document outlines the development of an AI-based resume screening tool using Python, NLP techniques, and similarity measures. The goal is to automate resume screening and identify the most suitable candidates for a given job description.

1. Project Goal: To build a system that efficiently screens resumes based on a provided job description, ranking candidates based on their suitability.

2. Dataset: The provided dataset (or a dataset sourced online) containing resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) will be used. For this example, we will assume the provided Google Drive link is accessible and contains resumes.

3. Technology Stack:
Python: Programming language.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal).
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): For generating contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic meaning for improved similarity calculations.
PyPDF2/pdfminer.six/docx2txt: For extracting text from different resume formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT). We'll use PyPDF2 as a starting point.
Cosine Similarity/Jaccard Similarity: For measuring the similarity between the job description and the extracted resume text. We'll use Cosine Similarity due to its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.
Scikit-learn: For implementing cosine similarity.

4. Step-by-Step Process:
4.1.1 Data Preprocessing
4.1.2. Text Cleaning
4.2. Feature extracting and Similarity Calculation

5.Output: The output will be a ranked list of resumes, sorted by their similarity score to the job description.

6.Further Enhancemant:
**UI Development (Django/Flask):**  Create a web interface for uploading resumes and job descriptions, visualizing the results.
**More Sophisticated NLP:** Explore named entity recognition (NER) to extract specific skills, experience, and education details.
**Handling Different Resume Formats:** Implement robust parsing for various resume formats.
**Evaluation Metrics:**  Use metrics like precision and recall to evaluate the system's performance.
**Customizable Weights:** Allow users to adjust the importance of different sections of the resume (e.g., skills, experience, education).
